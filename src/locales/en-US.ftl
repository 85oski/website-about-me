    I started learning programming at the age of 13,
    learning a lot of new things in this field.
    I decided to develop my passion in high school,
    choosing a technician-programmer course. In 2024, I was
    qualified for the Erasmus project, which resulted in an internship
    in Malaga and obtaining a certificate of completion of the project.
    In the future, I plan to work in this profession, because
    it gives me pleasure and I love creating new things.
